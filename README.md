File Krall_speciation.csv was sent to JRKrall by EPA in 11/2018.  These are the code files used to check and clean these data.  Here are the main files used to create the final datasets.

1. dat-sep-year.sh: File to take Krall_speciation.csv and separate into years, e.g. Krall_speciation-2000.csv.  
2. ussa-fulldat.R: File to take yearly speciation data (e.g. Krall_speciation-2000.csv) and format together based on information we need (columns, MDL, detection limits) and ensure dates are correct.  Also creates more concise method variable.
    * Creates dataset for monitor summary
    * Creates dataset for constituents of interest
    * Creates dataset for methods summary
    * Fix years of data (step 1 does not work perfectly because of modification dates)
    * *This is the file to modify if need to add/remove columns from speciation data*
3. blanks.R: Takes all blanks data and takes average for each constituent/year to blank correct metals.
4. blanks-sum.R: Takes revised blank data, restricts to 2000-2005 and summarizes
5. adjust-speciation.R: File to blank correct and adjust EC/OC from unadjusted TOT to TOR (based on technical manuals from Sunni). Also can adjust uncertainties and DLs

Data:
1. blanks-sum.RData generated by blanks-sum.R; contains summary of blanks for 2000-2005
2. cons.RData generated by ussa-fulldat.R; contains list of constituents
3. ecoc-am.RData generated by ecoc-am.R; contains values for EC/OC correction
4. methods-summ.RData generated by ussa-fulldat.R; contains methods summary for speciation data (exploration purposes only)
5. mons.RData generated by cities.R (internal); contains information on monitors used in Krall et al. 2013
6. moninfo.RData generated by ussa-fulldat.R; contains information on speciation monitors in the EPA speciation dataset
7. csndat2000-2005.csv and csndat2000-2005-bdl.csv generated by adjust-speciation.R; final blank-corrected and adjusted data
